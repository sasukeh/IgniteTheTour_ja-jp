# Dealing with a Massive Onset of Data Ingestion

How does a large company like Tailwind Traders build their data ingestion and processing pipelines, and chooses appropriate technologies to drive their business forward? This repo solves this problem by building a scalable and flexible end-to-end architecture that is capable of receiving massive amounts of data from variety of sources in real-time, and processing it.
